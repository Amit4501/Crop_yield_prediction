The basic need of a human body is served by Agriculture, and that’s much of the Indian population
has farming as their means of only and major source of income in the family. There are various 
factors on which the crop yield depends such as soil, weather, rain, pesticides and fertilizers,
these have direct impact on the production and so these are very important to be taken care of 
while the sowing of the seeds. With the digital advancements, and increased use of the latest
technologies in agriculture field, there is large amount of data being produced at rate which
is difficult to be maintained by the traditional systems. Identification of effectiveness of
data analytics is the main challenge in using data in agriculture has ‘Soil’ as the major parameter
being used to increase the crop production. Soil data set is being used, to predict the total yield 
of the crop, by applying Apriori algorithm and classify the crops using KNN algorithm. 
The parameters are being used are- types of soil, types of crops, nutrients, rainfall, climatic conditions. 

KEYWORDS- Big data, crop yield prediction, KNN classification algorithm , Apriori algorithm
